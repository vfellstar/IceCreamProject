 * PHP variables of the order to post things to the database.
 * variable name will be what the order is : value is the number ordered. We can then upload those numbers to the database.
 * The final key: value is the 'totalOrderCost' and the actual cost of that - important for Horsepay people.

 *
 * If we can submit JSON to the database we can make this easier but until then...
